<p> Original description of DCC++from Gregg, see below for complements for this library :</p>
<p>DCC++ BASE STATION is a C++ program written for the Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega using the Arduino IDE 1.6.6.</p>
<p>It allows a standard Arduino Uno or Mega with an Arduino Motor Shield (as well as others) to be used as a fully-functioning digital command and control (DCC) base station for controlling model train layouts that conform to current National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) DCC standards.</p>
<p>This version of DCC++ BASE STATION supports: </p><pre class="fragment">2-byte and 4-byte locomotive addressing
Simultaneous control of multiple locomotives
128-step speed throttling
Cab functions F0-F28
Activate/deactivate accessory functions using 512 addresses, each with 4 sub-addresses
  - includes optional functionality to monitor and store of the direction of any connected turnouts
Programming on the Main Operations Track
  - write configuration variable bytes
  - set/clear specific configuration variable bits
Programming on the Programming Track
  - write configuration variable bytes
  - set/clear specific configuration variable bits
  - read configuration variable bytes
</pre><p>DCC++ BASE STATION is controlled with simple text commands received via the Arduino's serial interface. Users can type these commands directly into the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, or can send such commands from another device or computer program.</p>
<p>When compiled for the Arduino Mega, an Ethernet Shield can be used for network communications instead of using serial communications.</p>
<p>DCC++ CONTROLLER, available separately under a similar open-source license, is a Java program written using the Processing library and Processing IDE that provides a complete and configurable graphic interface to control model train layouts via the DCC++ BASE STATION.</p>
<p>With the exception of a standard 15V power supply that can be purchased in any electronics store, no additional hardware is required.</p>
<p>Neither DCC++ BASE STATION nor DCC++ CONTROLLER use any known proprietary or commercial hardware, software, interfaces, specifications, or methods related to the control of model trains using NMRA DCC standards. Both programs are wholly original, developed by the author, and are not derived from any known commercial, free, or open-source model railroad control packages by any other parties.</p>
<p>However, DCC++ BASE STATION and DCC++ CONTROLLER do heavily rely on the IDEs and embedded libraries associated with Arduino and Processing. Tremendous thanks to those responsible for these terrific open-source initiatives that enable programs like DCC++ to be developed and distributed in the same fashion.</p>

<p>BRIEF NOTES ON THE THEORY AND OPERATION OF DCC++ BASE STATION:</p>
<p>DCC++ BASE STATION for the Uno configures the OC0B interrupt pin associated with Timer 0, and the OC1B interrupt pin associated with Timer 1, to generate separate 0-5V unipolar signals that each properly encode zero and one bits conforming with DCC timing standards. When compiled for the Mega, DCC++ BASE STATION uses OC3B instead of OC0B.</p>
<p>Series of DCC bit streams are bundled into Packets that each form the basis of a standard DCC instruction. Packets are stored in <a class="el" href="structPacket.html">Packet</a> Registers that contain methods for updating and queuing according to text commands sent by the user (or another program) over the serial interface. There is one set of registers that controls the main operations track and one that controls the programming track.</p>
<p>For the main operations track, packets to store cab throttle settings are stored in registers numbered 1 through MAX_MAIN_REGISTERS (as defined in <a class="el" href="DCCpp__Uno_8h_source.html">DCCpp_Uno.h</a>). It is generally considered good practice to continuously send throttle control packets to every cab so that if an engine should momentarily lose electrical connectivity with the tracks, it will very quickly receive another throttle control signal as soon as connectivity is restored (such as when a train passes over rough portion of track or the frog of a turnout).</p>
<p>DCC++ Base Station therefore sequentially loops through each main operations track packet register that has been loaded with a throttle control setting for a given cab. For each register, it transmits the appropriate DCC packet bits to the track, then moves onto the next register without any pausing to ensure continuous bi-polar power is being provided to the tracks. Updates to the throttle setting stored in any given packet register are done in a double-buffered fashion and the sequencer is pointed to that register immediately after being changes so that updated DCC bits can be transmitted to the appropriate cab without delay or any interruption in the bi-polar power signal. The cabs identified in each stored throttle setting should be unique across registers. If two registers contain throttle setting for the same cab, the throttle in the engine will oscillate between the two, which is probably not a desirable outcome.</p>
<p>For both the main operations track and the programming track there is also a special packet register with id=0 that is used to store all other DCC packets that do not require continuous transmittal to the tracks. This includes DCC packets to control decoder functions, set accessory decoders, and read and write Configuration Variables. It is common practice that transmittal of these one-time packets is usually repeated a few times to ensure proper receipt by the receiving decoder. DCC decoders are designed to listen for repeats of the same packet and provided there are no other packets received in between the repeats, the DCC decoder will not repeat the action itself. Some DCC decoders actually require receipt of sequential multiple identical one-time packets as a way of verifying proper transmittal before acting on the instructions contained in those packets</p>
<p>An Arduino Motor Shield (or similar), powered by a standard 15V DC power supply and attached on top of the Arduino Uno or Mega, is used to transform the 0-5V DCC logic signals produced by the Uno's Timer interrupts into proper 0-15V bi-polar DCC signals.</p>
<p>This is accomplished on the Uno by using one small jumper wire to connect the Uno's OC1B output (pin 10) to the Motor Shield's DIRECTION A input (pin 12), and another small jumper wire to connect the Uno's OC0B output (pin 5) to the Motor Shield's DIRECTION B input (pin 13).</p>
<p>For the Mega, the OC1B output is produced directly on pin 12, so no jumper is needed to connect to the Motor Shield's DIRECTION A input. However, one small jumper wire is needed to connect the Mega's OC3B output (pin 2) to the Motor Shield's DIRECTION B input (pin 13).</p>
<p>Other Motor Shields may require different sets of jumper or configurations (see <a class="el" href="commonPage.html">Configuration Lines</a> page for other details).</p>
<p>When configured as such, the CHANNEL A and CHANNEL B outputs of the Motor Shield may be connected directly to the tracks. This software assumes CHANNEL A is connected to the Main Operations Track, and CHANNEL B is connected to the Programming Track.</p>
<p>DCC++ BASE STATION in split into multiple modules, each with its own header file:</p>
<p>DCCpp_Uno: declares required global objects and contains initial Arduino setup() and Arduino loop() functions, as well as interrupt code for OC0B and OC1B. Also includes declarations of optional array of Turn-Outs and optional array of Sensors.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structTextCommand.html">TextCommand</a>: contains methods to read and interpret text commands from the serial/Ethernet line, process those instructions, and, if necessary call appropriate <a class="el" href="structPacket.html">Packet</a> <a class="el" href="structRegisterList.html">RegisterList</a> methods to update either the Main Track or Programming Track <a class="el" href="structPacket.html">Packet</a> Registers. (old name SerialCommand).</p>
<p>PacketRegister: contains methods to load, store, and update <a class="el" href="structPacket.html">Packet</a> Registers with DCC instructions.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structCurrentMonitor.html">CurrentMonitor</a>: contains methods to separately monitor and report the current drawn from CHANNEL A and CHANNEL B of the Arduino Motor Shield's, and shut down power if a short-circuit overload is detected.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structTurnout.html">Turnout</a>: contains methods to operate and store the status of any optionally-defined turnouts controlled by a DCC stationary accessory decoder. (old name Accessories).</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structSensor.html">Sensor</a>: contains methods to monitor and report on the status of optionally-defined infrared sensors embedded in the Main Track and connected to various pins on the Arduino Uno.</p>
<p>Output: contains methods to configure one or more Arduino pins as an output for your own custom use.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structEEStore.html">EEStore</a>: contains methods to store, update, and load various DCC settings and status (e.g. the states of all defined turnouts) in the EEPROM for recall after power-up. </p><hr/>
<p>Complement of the documentation for this library:</p>
<p>This library is a free interpretation of the Gregg's work to adapt it to a library, and minimize the needs to modify the library sources to use it. The only configuration still needed in .h file is to decide of the Ethernet interface model. It has been adapted to work also with Arduino Nano R3 and ESP32 on IDE 1.8.4 . Aside from text commands, a <a class="el" href="classDCCpp.html">DCCpp</a> class can also send orders through methods without any text. </p>
